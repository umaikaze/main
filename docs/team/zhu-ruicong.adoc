== PROJECT: Pet Store Helper

---

== Overview

Pet Store Helper(PSH) is a desktop application used for pet store owners to manage different aspects of their pet store including pet logging, scheduling and inventory management. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 16kLOC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: *added the inventory display system*
** What it does: allows the user to view the summary of weekly food types and amounts required to maintain the pets in the store.
** Justification: This feature improves the usefulness of the product for pet store owners significantly as it helps the user to visualize, understand and organize food consumptions in the pet shop.
** Highlights: This enhancement uses a split screen which led to the redesign of the UI component. A major challenge tackled was the synchronization of data of the Inventory system with the Pet system, which required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives of the data model.

* *Minor enhancement*: added a feature where users can click on each food item in the inventory to view the breakdown of food amounts by pet names.
