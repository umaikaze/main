By: `AY1920S2-CS2103-W15-4`      Since: `Feb 2020`      Licence: `MIT`

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `11`* or above
. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.

=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `clzzz.helper.Main` and try a few commands
. <<Running-Tests,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the SE-EDU branding and refer to the `AY1920S2-CS2103-W15-4/main` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `AY1920S2-CS2103-W15-4/main`), you should do the following:

. Configure the site-wide documentation settings in `build.gradle`, such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in `DeveloperGuide.adoc` and `UserGuide.adoc` with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork.

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI.

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the diagrams folder at `docs/diagrams`.

`Main` has two classes called `Main` and `MainApp`. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

`Commons` represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* `UI`: The UI of the App.
* `Logic`: The command executor.
* `Model`: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* `Storage`: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `deletepet 1`.

[[Calendar-Class-Diagram]]
.Structure of the Calendar Component in UI
image::UiCalendarDiagram.png[]

.Structure of the DisplayList Component in UI
image::UiDisplayListDiagram.png[]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` class that is made up of parts which can be classified broadly into 2 groups:

* (Group 1) Parts that are always displayed at all times, which include `CommandBox`, `FeedbackDisplay`, `StatusBarFooter`, etc. These parts appear above `MainWindow` in the class diagram for UI.
* (Group 2) Parts that are selectively displayed, depending on the command entered by the user. Only some of these parts will be shown at any one instance. These include the `Calendar` and `DisplayList` components, and `OverallStatistics`. These parts appear beneath `MainWindow` in the class diagram for UI.

All the UI classes, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the `MainWindow` is specified in `MainWindow.fxml`.

In addition, each UI part has been styled using CSS. The custom CSS styling rules are defined in multiple CSS stylesheets, which can be found in the `src/main/resources/view/stylesheets` folder.

The `UI` component does the following:

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data to update the UI with the modified data.
* Handles a returned `CommandResult` to perform additional actions, e.g. show the help window, exit the program, display the appropriate part or component from Group 2, etc.

// end::design-ui[]

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

.  `Logic` uses the `PetTrackerParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a pet).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("deletepet 1")` API call.

_Written by Zhu Ruicong_

=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Pet Store Helper data. Note that the Pet Tracker keeps track of a UniquePetList, which in turn maintains the Pet system, Schedule system and Inventory(FoodCollection) system.
* exposes an `ObservableList<Pet>`, an `ObservableList<Slot>`, and an `ObservableList<FoodCollection>` that are unmodifiable and can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::implementation-display[]
=== Display switching feature

_Written by Dylan Lim_

==== Implementation

The display mechanism is facilitated by an `ObservableList` of `DisplayItem` s called `filteredDisplayItems`, which is an attribute stored in `ModelManager`.

Any class that is to be displayed as an item in a list implements the `DisplayItem` interface. This interface has a single method named `getDisplaySystemType` which returns the type of system to be displayed. In our program, the `Pet`, `Slot`, `FoodCollection`, and `FoodAmountAndPet` classes implement this interface.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the display mechanism behaves at each step.

**Step 1**. The user opens the app the the 1st time. A few things happen at start-up:

- In `Model` (`ModelManager`), `filteredDisplayItems` is created, and is set to bind to `filteredPets`. This way, `filteredDisplayItems` contains all the elements of `filteredPets`, and any changes to `filteredPets` will also be automatically propogated to `filteredDisplayItems`.

- In the `MainWindow`, a `DisplayListPanel` and a `CalendarPanel` are initialized. The `DisplayListPanel` is created with `filteredDisplayItems` as its backing list, while the `CalendarPanel` will be initialized with the `List` of `Slot` s obtained from `logic.getPetTracker().getSlotList()`.

- The `resultDisplayPlaceholder` component in the `MainWindow` is set to display the `DisplayListPanel`. As such, the user sees the list of pets as the initial display.

**Step 2**. The user executes `display c` to have the slots displayed in calendar view. Since `filteredDisplayItems` is not used for displaying the calendar, it is not changed when the `display` command calls `Model#changeDisplaySystem`. Upon receiving back the result of the command in `MainWindow`, `resultDisplayPlaceholder` is changed to display the `CalendarPanel` instead of the `DisplayListPanel`.

The following sequence diagrams shows how the display is switched to calendar:

.Sequence diagram for switching display to calendar
image::DisplayCalendarSequenceDiagram0.png[]

.Excecution of "display c" in Logic component
image::DisplayCalendarSequenceDiagram1.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `CommandResult`, `DisplayParser`, and `DisplayCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

**Step 3**. The user executes `display s` to have the slots displayed in a list. The `display` command calls `Model#changeDisplaySystem`, which causes `filteredDisplayItems` to re-binded to `filteredSlots`. Since the program should now display a list of items instead of a calendar, upon receiving back the result of the command in `MainWindow`, `resultDisplayPlaceholder` is changed to display the `DisplayListPanel` from `CalendarPanel`.

The following sequence diagrams shows how the display is switched to slots list view:

.Sequence diagram for switching display to slots list view
image::DisplaySlotSequenceDiagram0.png[]

.Excecution of "display s" in Logic component
image::DisplaySlotSequenceDiagram1.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `CommandResult`, `DisplayParser`, and `DisplayCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens in `MainWindow#executeCommand` upon the return of a command result:

image::DisplaySwitchingActivityDiagram.png[]

// end::implementation-display[]

// tag::schedule[]
=== Schedule feature

_Written by Zhao Mingjian_

==== Implementation

The schedule feature uses instances of class `Slot` to organise bathing schedule for the pets. Each `Slot` contains a
starting time of the bath, stored internally as a `LocalDateTime`, and the duration of the bath stored internally as a
`Duration`. It stores a reference to the `Pet` in the `ModelManager` as specified by the user.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `Schedule` mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application with some pets stored (`Garfield`, for instance). `ObservableList<Slot>`
in `Schedule` is currently empty.

Step 2. The user executes `addslot n/Garfield t/1/4/2020 1200 d/120` command to create a `Slot` for `Garfield`.
The `AddSlotCommandParser` calls `parsePet()` in `SlotParserUtil`, which then takes in the `Model` passed in to find a
reference for the specific `Pet` with `Model.getPet()`. Prior to this stage, if the name string is invalid, a
`ParseException(MESSAGE_INVALID_PETNAME)` will be thrown. Or the program cannot find the `Pet` in the model, a
`ParseException(MESSAGE_PET_DOES_NOT_EXIST)` will be thrown. This ensures that every slot created actually points to an
existing `Pet` found in `PetTracker`.

[NOTE]
If `parsePet()` fails its execution, no new `Slot` is created.

Step 3. New `Slot` is created.

Step 4. The user now decides that this exact slot should be occupied by another pet, and decides to edit it, executing
the `editslot` command.

Step 5. `SlotParserUtil` is used again to create a reference to a pet in the `ModelManager`.

Step 6. The user now decides that they need to see slots occupied by a particular pet on a particular date, executing
the `findslots n/Garfield t/1/4/2020` command.

Step 7. The `FindSlotCommand` reduces the two predicates* and pass it to `ModelManager` to create a filtered list of
slots.

*The `FindSlotCommand` uses the following classes which both inherit `Predicate<Slot>` to search for the user specified
slots:

* `SlotPetNamePredicate()` -- Internally stores the `Name` to search for, and compares it with
`getPet().getName().fullName`.
* `SlotDateTimePredicate()` -- Internally stores the `LocalDateTime` to search for (Timing will be ignored), and
compares it with `getDate()`.

The activity diagram below is an illustration of the flow of events that happen in the model component when the steps
above occurs.

image::FindSlotParserDiagram.png[]

Given below is an example usage scenario that demonstrates how the `Schedule` system integrates with the `Pet` system.

Step 1. The user launches the application with a pet stored: `Garfield`. A single instance of `Slot` occupies
`ObservableList<Slot>` in `Schedule`, whose parameters are: `petName: Garfield`,
`dateTime: 11/4/2020 1200`, `duration: 40`. Upon launch, a `PetListChangeListener` will be attached to `internalList` of
`UniquePetList`.

Step 2. The user executes `deletepet 1` command to delete `Garfield` from the `UniquePetList`. When user deletes the pet,
function `onChanged` in `PetListChangeListener` is called. This function calls `removeExcessSlot` within the
`PetListChangeListener` for each pet removed.

Step 3. `removeExcessSlot` calls `remove` in `Schedule` to remove slots based on the name of the removed pet.

Step 4. The user now have successfully removed `Garfield` and all the slots the pet used to occupy.

The sequence diagram below is an illustration of the flow of events that happen in the model component when the steps
above occurs.

image::SlotAutoUpdateSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: How schedule stores the pets internally

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Makes a reference to the the memory address in `ModelManager` .
** Pros: When the pet is edited, it is easier to update the corresponding slot. Also reduces save file size and
conserve system memory as there will be no duplicate information.
** Cons: Harder to implement and test. Testing requires a sample list of pets to be instantiated first.
* **Alternative 2:** Simply create a new Pet.
** Pros: Easy to implement and test (A refactor of `Pet`), low coupling with `Model`.
** Cons: Harder to synchronize with any changes in `UniquePetList`

// end::schedule[]

// tag::implementation-calendar[]
=== Calendar feature

_Written by Dylan Lim_

==== Implementation

The class diagram for calendar-related components, as shown in <<Calendar-Class-Diagram>> previously, is reproduced in this section for convenience.

.Structure of the Calendar Component in UI
image::UiCalendarDiagram.png[]

The construction of the calendar is accomplished by the `construct()` method in `CalendarPanel`. Based on the list of all slots in the system, it determines which type of `CalendarRegion` is to be placed at which position of the `GridPane` in `CalendarPanel`.

.Respective `CalendarRegion` s marked out
image::CalendarViewAnnotated.png[]

In tha above annotated screenshot, rectangles with the following border color correspond to the following `CalendarRegion` (from left to right, on 7/4/2020):

- Purple: `CalendarDate`. It is used to display the day and date of slots in the same row, and it always positioned to the left.
- Green: `CalendarSlot`. It constitutes a single slot.
- Yellow: `CalendarBuffer`. It acts a buffer between other regions, for padding purposes.
- Blue: `CalendarConflict`. It represents a region of more than two or more conflicted slots.


The following activity diagram outlines the rough flow of `calendarPanel#construct`:

.Activity diagram for construction of calendar.
image::CalendarConstructActivityDiagram.png[]

.Activity diagram for creating new `CalendarRegion` for slot(s) in holding.
image::CalendarNewRegionHoldingActivityDiagram.png[]


`CalendarRegion` s are created sequentially, from left to right (increasing time of day), then top to bottom (increasing date). Each time a `CalendarRegion` is created, it is placed onto a `GridPane` based on the row index, and its starting time.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Construction of calendar upon addition / deletion / edition of slot(s)

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Clear all components in `CalendarPanel` and redraw everything.
** Pros: Relatively simpler to implement.
** Cons: Might take a long time to draw if system has many slots.
* **Alternative 2:** Modify only the component that is related the affected slot.
** Pros: Better performance.
** Cons: More complex implementation needed to determine and resolve  conflicts, if any.

// end::implementation-calendar[]

// tag::inventory_feature[]
=== Inventory feature

_Written by Zhu Ruicong_

==== Implementation

The Inventory feature gives a summary of all the food items involved in a pet tracker system.
It is supported by `FoodCollection` which resembles a collection of food of the same type and `FoodCollectionList` which is a list of these collections.
A `FoodCollectionList` is stored as an attribute of `UniquePetList` for the following reasons:

* The list of `FoodCollection` items associated with a `UniquePetList` can be directly derived from the `UniquePetList` itself.
* Changes in FoodCollection occurs only if there is a change in `UniquePetList#internalList`.

Data stored in `FoodCollectionList` is exposed to `ModelManager` through `UniquePetList` and `PetTracker` as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<FoodCollection>`.
`ModelManager` then passes the list of `FoodCollection` to UI for display as a list of `DisplayItem` when `display i` is called.

// tag::inventory_diagram[]
The following shows a typical usage scenario that involves the Display Inventory feature.

* Step 1: The user launches the application. A `UniquePetList` is initialized in `PetTracker`, upon which a `FoodCollectionList` item is created to store the food data of the pets in the list(if it is an empty list, `FoodCollectionList` is also stores an empty list of `FoodCollection`)
* Step 2: The user executes 'display i' command. The `display` command calls Model#ChangeDisplaySystem() and the `i` display type determines the displayed list is switched to `ObservableList<FoodCollection>`. `Model#getFilteredDisplayList()` then acquires the list and sends it to Ui unit for display.
* Step 3: The user inputs a command that modifies the `UniquePetList`, e.g 'editpet 1 f/catfood:100'. `UniquePetList#internalList` is an instance of `ObservableList<Pet>`. Thus when it is modified, a `ListChangeListener<Pet>` is woken up and it calls `UniquePetList#updateFoodCollectionList()` to update the `FoodCollectionList` according to the modified Pet list.

The sequence diagram below is an illustration of the flow of events that happen in the logical component when `Step 2` above occurs.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `display i` Command
image::DisplayInventorySequenceDiagram.png[]

Note that there is no explicit initialization or update for `FoodCollection` in `FoodCollectionList`. `FoodCollectionList` is synchronized to the list of pet(`UniquePetList#internalList`) in the `UniquePetList` through `ListChangeListener<Pet>`, which is triggered whenever there is a change in the pet list. The sequence diagram below and the steps illustrates this process:

* Step 1: `UniquePetList` passes its `internalList`(referred to as `petList` in the sequence diagram below).
* Step 2: `FoodCollectionList` creates a new `FoodCollectionList` object `temp` and extracts `temp#internalList`.
* Step 3: Replaces the content in the current `internalList` with the content in the extracted `temp#internalist`.

.Interactions Inside Model Class when `ListChangeListener<Pet>` is triggered
image::FoodCollectionListChangeSequenceDiagram.png[]
// end::inventory_diagram[]

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Maintaining the collection of food in a pet tracker
* Alternative 1(current choice): Maintains the list as an attribute of `UniquePetList`.
** Pros: Easier to initialize and update the list.
** Cons: Less extendability. Adding additional food items in inventory(independent of pet list) is difficult.

* Alternative 2: Maintains a list of food collections separate from `UniquePetList`.
** Pros: Higher Extendability that supports more independent operations of FoodCollection List.
** Cons: More difficult to constantly update and maintain the food collection list should food list changes.

===== Aspect: Updating the collection of food when pet list is modified.
* Alternative 1(current choice): Replace the entire list by a new food collection list created from the updated pet list.
** Pros: Easy to implement and no adaptation is required for different types of modification of pet list.
** Cons: Computationally intensive when there is a huge pet list.

* Alternative 2: Modify `FoodCollection` affected by the command.
** Pros: Less computationally intensive and more responsive given a large database.
** Cons: Adaptations for each pet related commands is required since the food list can be affected in different ways.(e.g addition, modification, deletion)
// end::inventory_feature[]

//tag::conflict[]
=== Conflict feature
_Written by Zhao Tianqi_

==== Implementation
The conflict feature shows a list of all slots that has overlapping time period.

* It makes uses of `SlotConflictPredicate` which implements `SlotPredicate` to filter slots that has a conflicting timing with some other slots.
* If the screen is displaying shortlisted slots, `conflics` only shows slots with conflicts among the shortlisted list. Otherwise, it shows conflicts in the full slot list
* The command automatically switch display to slots.

Below is a scenario of using `conflicts` command:

* Step 1: The user inputs "conflicts" in the command line. The Logic component processes the input and creates a new instance of `ConflictCommand`
* Step 2: The `ConflictCommand` access `filteredSlots` in `Model`, and create a new instance of `SlotConflictPredicate` with `filteredSlots`.
* Step 3: `Model` filters slots that is conflicting among the `filteredSlots` using the `SlotConflictPredicate`.
* Step 4: `ConflictCommand` changes `currentDisplaySystemType` in `Model` to `DisplaySystemType.SCHEDULE` such that the window will display shortlisted conflicting slots.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `conflicts` Command
image::ConflictSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Data structure to store slots and method of checking for conflicts:
* Alternative 1 (current choice): Store slots in a list, with pairwise comparison between elements to find out conflicts
** Pros: More straightforward in implementation
** Cons: The performance might not be scalable. Algorithm does not minimize the computation time.
* Alternative 2: Store slots in an interval tree
** Pros: Searching for conflicting slots takes less time. The algorithm is more efficient.
** Cons: Implementation of the data structure needs relatively high level of commitment.
//end::conflict[]

//tag::stats[]
=== Statistics
_Written by Zhao Tianqi_

==== Implementation

We are generating the overall statistics of Pet Store Helper and translate the data in a user-friendly manner.

* `OverallStats` under UI component handles the translation of three sets of data: list of pets, schedule, and list of inventory.
* Data in `OverallStats` is obtained from `Logic`.
* The statistics displayed will automatically update if there is a change  in any related information.

How we implemented overall statistic on UI:

* The statistics for pets are shown in a form of pie chart, while the pets are grouped according to their species.
* The schedule statistics is in the form of a timetable of recent 3 days. Each slot is represented as a shaded rectangle in the timetable.
* The inventory data are generated from the list of pets, and grouped together by their names, such that users have a better understanding of overall food consumption. The list of inventory is represented as a bar chart.

Here is the process of how the overall statistics is displayed to the user:

* Step 1: The user key in the command 'stats', then the Logic component processes the input and creates an instance of `StatsCommand`.
The `StatsCommand` first calls `Model#updateAll()` to make sure that the model will update `filteredPets`, `filteredSlots`, and `filteredFoodCollections` to show the full list of `Pet`, `Slot` and `FoodCollection` in the `PetTracker`.
After that, the `StatsCommand` calls `Model#changeDisplaySystem(DisplaySystemType.STATISTICS`) such that the application will later switch the window to show `OverallStats`.
In the Ui component, there is a new instance of `OverallStats` created, while `Model#getFilteredPets`, `Model#getFilteredSlots`, and `Model#getFilteredFoodCollections` are passed in the instance for processing. `OverallStats` then generates diagrams according to the data passes in.

* Step 2: The user inputs a command that modifies the UniquePetList, e.g 'editpet 1 s/cat'. The `CommandResult` of any `EditPetCommand` has `type` with `DisplaySystemType.NO_CHANGE`. The Ui component identifies the `type` in the `CommandResult` and then refresh the window if it is `NO_CHANGE`. In this case, the window will refresh and create another new instance of `OverallStats` with the updated list of pets. Therefore the window always shows statistics of the most updated list of pets, slots and food collections.

Following is the sequential diagram of the command `stats`

.Interactions Inside the *Logic* Component for the `stats` Command
image::StatsLogicSequenceDiagram.png[]

.Interactions Inside the *Ui* Component for the `stats` Command
image::StatsUiSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: How to update diagrams when there are changes
* Alternative 1 (current choice): Refresh the screen
** Pros: Easy to implement and only need to refer to `model` to get data.
** Cons: Takes time to process the whole lists of data even though there is only one small change in one of the item (pets, slots or foo collection). This approach might be time consuming when the data size is too large.
* Alternative 2: Make use of `Listener` to detect change in `UniquePetList` and make changes accordingly
** Pros: Avoid unnecessary processing of data. e.g. The diagrams need not be regenerated when there is no change in pet species, pet food, and recent schedule.
** Cons: More complicated implementation. There might be more coupling between `OverallStats` under Ui component and Listener class under Model component.
//end::stats[]

//tag::backup_and_load_feature[]

=== Back up and load feature

_Written by Chen Shenghao_

==== Implementation
The back up/load mechanism is facilitated by `Storage`.

`Storage` is extended to implement the following operations:

* `savePetTracker#(ReadOnlyPetTracker, LocalDateTime)` -- calls `savePetTracker#(ReadOnlyPetTracker, Path)` after converting LocalDateTime to Path
* `savePetTracker#(ReadOnlyPetTracker, Path)` -- saves pet tracker data to specified path

The back up/load mechanism follows the exact same steps taken when data is saved after each operation and read at initialization. This ensures maximum compatibility and reduces the need for additional code.

`backup` should never fail unless the saving of data after every operation also fails. For 'load', there are two additional caveats, the specified file should exist and be in the correct format. This is unlike the reading of data at initialization which simply resorts to an empty file instead if these issues occur.

The following sequence diagram shows how the backup operation works:

image::BackUpSequenceDiagram.png[]

The following sequence diagram shows how the load operation works:

image::LoadSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How back up & load executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Executed by Command, following general pattern for Command
** Pros: Easy to implement, able to rely on established pattern for Command.
** Cons: Storage is exposed to classes in the `parser` package, which should not have access to its methods
* **Alternative 2:** Executed by LogicManager, which already saves data to hard disk after every operation
** Pros: Storage does not have to be passed to classes in the `parser` package
** Cons: Requires passing instruction back to LogicManager, actual operation performed after end of Command#execute(), unable to obtain reliable success/error message.

//end::backup_and_load_feature[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of
just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).





== Documentation

We use Asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose Asciidoc over Markdown because Asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

We used Gradle to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end results of edits. Also, we downloaded the AsciiDoc plugin for Intellij, which allowed use to preview the changes made to the `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Editing Diagrams

We used the PlantUML plugin for Intellij to create and update the UML diagrams.

=== Publishing Documentation

We used Travis for deployment of Github Pages for publishing documentation.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use Google Chrome for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

[[Docs-SiteWideDocSettings]]
=== Site-wide Documentation Settings

The `build.gradle` file specifies some project-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how all documentation files within this project are rendered.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in the `build.gradle` file will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of site-wide attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-name`
|The name of the website.
If set, the name will be displayed near the top of the page.
|_not set_

|`site-githuburl`
|URL to the site's repository on https://github.com[GitHub].
Setting this will add a "View on GitHub" link in the navigation bar.
|_not set_

|`site-seedu`
|Define this attribute if the project is an official SE-EDU project.
This will render the SE-EDU navigation bar at the top of the page, and add some SE-EDU-specific navigation items.
|_not set_

|===

[[Docs-PerFileDocSettings]]
=== Per-file Documentation Settings

Each `.adoc` file may also specify some file-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how the file is rendered.

Asciidoctor's https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#builtin-attributes[built-in attributes] may be specified and used as well.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in `.adoc` files will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of per-file attributes, excluding Asciidoctor's built-in attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-section`
|Site section that the document belongs to.
This will cause the associated item in the navigation bar to be highlighted.
One of: `UserGuide`, `DeveloperGuide`, ``LearningOutcomes``{asterisk}, `AboutUs`, `ContactUs`

_{asterisk} Official SE-EDU projects only_
|_not set_

|`no-site-header`
|Set this attribute to remove the site navigation bar.

=== Site Template

The files in `docs/stylesheets` are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in `docs/templates` controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in `docs/templates` requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.

== Testing

[[Running-Tests]]
=== Running Tests

There are two ways to run tests.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean test` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean test`)

=== Types of tests

We have three types of tests:

.  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `clzzz.helper.commons.util.StringUtilTest`
.  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `clzzz.helper.storage.StorageManagerTest`
.  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `clzzz.helper.logic.LogicManagerTest`

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

We use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use Travis CI and AppVeyor to perform Continuous Integration.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use Coveralls to track the code coverage.

=== Documentation Previews

When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in `MainApp.java`.
.  Generate a JAR file using Gradle.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

Project dependencies are managed by Gradle, and are not included in this repository.

List of dependencies:

* https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson[Jackson]
* https://junit.org/junit5/[JUnit 5]
* https://openjfx.io/[JavaFX]
